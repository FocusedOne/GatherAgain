# GatherAgain
 html shell for Pastor's Tool Box form

 The CSS on this page is out of control.  I intend to break that out into a separate file like a civilized human would.

 This shell is (nearly) identical to the /staffportalv2.htm.  Once the above change is complete I intend to update both pages so they match.

 For some clarity: the page / file we went with is "welcomehome.htm" - this was a branding decision from leadership.  "gatheragain.thm" and "togetheragain.htm" have not been modified.
 All changes going forward are to the Welcome Home page.

 As it is at the moment, all the CSS is on this page.  W3Schools had a cert error in the middle of this, so I copied their CSS file into one called "w3cssbackup.css".  The original ref to w3css is commented out.

 If you remove the comment from that line referencing w3css, this is a one-page template for the Pastor's Toolbox iframe.
