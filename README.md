# GatherAgain
 html shell for Pastor's Tool Box form

(Almost all) of the CSS is now broken out into a separate file.  I never could get the storyteamvideo style to work without it in the page, so there it remains.

 This shell is (nearly) identical to the /staffportalv2.htm.  I've made several changes to both pages - I think they're caught up.

 At some point I need to start a separate "template only" page where I make head/foot/nav changes and then copy/paste them over to the other pages.  There's probably a fancy github way to do that.

 For some clarity: the page / file we went with is "welcomehome.htm" - this was a branding decision from leadership.  "gatheragain.thm" and "togetheragain.htm" are outdated.
 All changes going forward are to the Welcome Home page.

 As it is at the moment, all the CSS is on this page.  W3Schools had a cert error in the middle of this, so I copied their CSS file into one called "w3cssbackup.css".  The original ref to w3css is commented out.

 Made a few formatting changes for small screens to better handle the nav.  Our church logo is in the top right, so you'd want to change that.

 If you remove the comment from that line referencing w3css, this is a one-page template for the Pastor's Toolbox iframe.
